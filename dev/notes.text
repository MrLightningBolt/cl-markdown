current-element should error if current-element-p is nil

`code` keeps processing other span things...

warnings: unused links, unfound links, bad structure...

The following screws us -- oh oh! or not?!

  > Example:
  > 
  >     sub status {
  >         print "working";
  >     }

the problem is that we see a BQ at level two and then Code at level 3
Our current paragraph encoding loses the fact that the code is also blockquoted.
At least, our rendering does. or does it?

ok - remove extra spaces
  (:P "First " (:STRONG "paragraph") "") -> (:P "First " (:STRONG "paragraph"))

We need to be more careful about the difference between spaces and Tabs 

Gary King 2006-05-01: 

I _think_ I understand the basic structure of the program again

There is oddness all over. Sign of the need for a complete redesign or just focused cleanup

Do we really have enough 'context' to recreate the stream properly? Look at : 

"X
* Item 1
    * sub-item a

    this is part of item 1's description
    > quote this 
    >> and this
    > He said two things?
    >> * thing 1
    >> * and thing 2
    
* item 2"

1. poc: get something simple to HTML / LML2
  a. block structure is confused
  b. output is close... 
2. tests for block structure
3. tests for output
4. PDF
5. extensions

What do we do about ## hello ## (do we remove the ending ##...?)

LIFT: if get a warning, then no test defined (b/c muffle warnings?)
 LIFT::TEST-SUITE TEST-BLAZ previously defined in: New 10
         is now being redefined in: BASIC-GEOM:utils;cl-markdown;dev;lml2.lisp

Where is this?
  finish block structure
  finish spans
  test with Tidy
  handle escapes
  encoding
  to DOM
  to HTML
  to PDF
  extend with footnotes, etc...

Convert output to LML2 style??

When you do want to insert a <br /> break tag using Markdown, you end a 
line with two or more spaces, then type return.

current stripping strategy fails for BQs; must remove layer or won't see what is
  beyond it.

Need smarter "this is a paragraph" logic

Merge lines into long strings...

Note that Markdown formatting syntax is not processed within block-level HTML tags. E.g., you canÕt use Markdown-style *emphasis* inside an HTML block.

Unlike block-level HTML tags, Markdown syntax is processed within span-level tags.

However, inside Markdown code spans and blocks, angle brackets and ampersands are always encoded automatically. This makes it easy to use Markdown to write about HTML code.

We want to handle _(Wiki links), ^(links?), #H(hyperspec), etc

maybe merge paragraphs? merge-paragraphs-p, merge-paragraphs
  would make some kinds of things easier

Why? Efficiency, propaganda, etc.

notes

- could tokenize via whitespace with some escaping.
So *bog* -> '*bog*' but \*bog\* -> '*' 'bog' '*'
No, WS matters to MD; also, HTML is processed within some stuff but not others
Maybe could parse groups of spaces at the start of line specially.

is some funkiness regarding single quotes...

ok - Horizontal Rules: You can produce a horizontal rule tag (<hr />) by placing 
three or more hyphens, asterisks, or underscores on a line by themselves. If 
you wish, you may use spaces between the hyphens or asterisks. Each of the 
following lines will produce a horizontal rule:
ok - when replacing more than once for a single scanner
ok - List markers typically start at the left margin, but may be indented by up to three spaces. List markers must be followed by one or more spaces or a tab.
ok - links: recognize in and out of band link lines and store
  CCPRE
ok - LIFT: need a warning when redefining some tests... at least the class or something?
